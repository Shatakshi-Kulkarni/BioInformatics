**BIOINFORMATICS TUTORIALS:**

Welcome to this repository of Bioinformatics tutorials. These presentations were initially developed as part of my Teaching Assistantship in Bioinformatics. The tutorials cover fundamental topics, including the basics of Bioinformatics, various databases, and sequence alignment concepts. I will continue to add new tutorials to this repository, so stay tuned!
